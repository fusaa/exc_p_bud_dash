# MS Excel Dashboard Interactive Budget Tracker

Project description
MS Excel Dashboard Interactive Budget Tracker

In this project, I created a spreadsheet for budget tracking. In the first moment, the user can input an estimated budget for any desired period on a specific sheet. 

The user has a tracking table where he can make inputs like income and expenses. 

The great thing about this spreadsheet is the dashboard. It shows detailed information on the left pane across different expense groups(even if the user generates a new expense type, it gets updated automatically). 

Moreover, four other graphs add up to the experience. Three of them(Income, Savings, Expensive) show the percentage of the main categories inside each group. Finally, the bar chart shows the evolution of the different categories throughout the months, allowing for a perfect understanding of the budget behaviour over time.

This spreadsheet can be ported to additional complex projects like business expenses.
